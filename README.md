ðŸŽ¯ ObjectiveDesign and implement a generic, type-safe repository pattern in TypeScript to manage static in-memory data. You will apply generics, interfaces, and inheritance, while simulating typical backend logic.

ðŸ“¦ What You'll Build
A generic repository interface that supports CRUD + filtering
A base repository class that implements this interface
Three separate model repositories that inherit from the base
Static data for testing each model
A script that tests and logs each method
ðŸ“‹ Task Requirements
Define this Three Data Models 

User, Course, and Booking   
Each model must include an id as required and a few relevant properties.
Create a Generic Repository Interface , The interface must define the following methods, all returning Promises:
                 Fetch all items
                 Fetch one item by ID
                 Create a new item
                 Update an existing item
                 Delete an item by ID
                 Find items by filter (using partial fields)
Implement a Generic Base Repository Class , This class must:
                Accept any model type that includes an id field 
                Store data in-memory (array)
                Implement all interface methods in a generic, reusable way
 Implement Model-Specific Repositories Create one class per model that extends the base repository , Each class:
                Should pass static data to the base class
                May include additional methods (optional)
Seed Static Data Each repository instance must be initialized with at least 2â€“3 sample records ,Use this data to simulate real-world behavior in your tests.
Test the Full Flow In a separate script:
                Create each repository instance
                Test and log the output of each method defined in the interface
Ensure results are type-safe and async-compatible



note : the code must push to github repo
